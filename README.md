### Description
In statistics, linear regression is an approach for modeling the relationship between a scalar dependent variable and one or more explanatory variables. This is a sample for a 1 dimensional linear regression - simple linear regression. It fits a straight line through the set of n points in such a way that makes the sum of squared residuals of the model as small as possible.
